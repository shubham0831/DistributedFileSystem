Project Retrospective

1) How many extra days did you use for the project?

	More than I should have. But to be fair, I started the project all over again after my first attempt

2) Given the same goals, how would you complete the project differently?

	Would optimize my SQL queries, and make fewer queries to the database in general. Maybe spend more time about how to distribute the chunks to the storage node

3) Letâ€™s imagine that your next project was to improve and extend P1. What are the features/functionality you would add, use cases you would support, etc?

	Add a load balancing mechanism, reduce the size of my chunks, add a progress bar, make the ui much better.
	Try to give the client a copy of the file system, and make handle those requests at the client side.

4) Give a rough estimate of how long you spent completing this assignment.

	60 hours

5) What did you learn from completing this project?

	Learnt go, and how a dfs works
